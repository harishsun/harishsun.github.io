# AWS Journey
Embarking on My AWS Adventure

Hi there!

I'm setting out to explore the vast world of Amazon Web Services (AWS), and I want you to join me on this journey. Here's what you can expect from this blog:

Daily Updates: I'll post daily on my progress, what I've learned, and any cool AWS tricks I pick up along the way.
Learning Recap: Each post will summarize key AWS concepts or services I've delved into.

This blog is my logbook, a place where I'll track my journey through the AWS landscape, from the basics to maybe even beyond. Let's learn together!

Stay Tuned!

- Day 6 (14/11/2024): **A Hiccup, But Still On Track**:
  Yesterday was one of those days where life outside of my AWS learning plan took over. As much as I’ve committed to dedicating time daily to this journey, sometimes work demands get in the way. Yesterday, I had to prioritize a professional commitment that involved significant travel, leaving me unable to complete my planned study session.
  
  However, this experience reminded me of an important lesson that’s true for any kind of learning journey: flexibility and resilience are key. While I couldn’t stick to my daily routine, I’ve made it a point not to let this become a setback. Instead, today, I’m making sure to double down on my studies and cover both yesterday's and today's planned tasks.
  
  To those following a similar path, remember that progress is more about consistency over time than perfection every day. It’s okay to hit a bump in the road, as long as you make the conscious effort to get back on track.
  
  I’ll be diving back into my AWS Solutions Architect studies using Stephan Marek’s resources, and I’m excited to make up for lost time. Expect updates on the concepts I explore and how I apply them in practice in my next post.
  
  Stay motivated, and let’s keep pushing forward!
