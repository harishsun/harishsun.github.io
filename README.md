# AWS Journey
Embarking on My AWS Adventure

Hi there!

I'm setting out to explore the vast world of Amazon Web Services (AWS), and I want you to join me on this journey. Here's what you can expect from this blog:

Daily Updates: I'll post daily on my progress, what I've learned, and any cool AWS tricks I pick up along the way.
Learning Recap: Each post will summarize key AWS concepts or services I've delved into.

This blog is my logbook, a place where I'll track my journey through the AWS landscape, from the basics to maybe even beyond. Let's learn together!

Stay Tuned!

- Day 6 (14/11/2024): **A Hiccup, But Still On Track**:
  Yesterday was one of those days where life outside of my AWS learning plan took over. As much as I’ve committed to dedicating time daily to this journey, sometimes work demands get in the way. Yesterday, I had to prioritize a professional commitment that involved significant travel, leaving me unable to complete my planned study session.
  
  However, this experience reminded me of an important lesson that’s true for any kind of learning journey: flexibility and resilience are key. While I couldn’t stick to my daily routine, I’ve made it a point not to let this become a setback. Instead, today, I’m making sure to double down on my studies and cover both yesterday's and today's planned tasks.
  
  To those following a similar path, remember that progress is more about consistency over time than perfection every day. It’s okay to hit a bump in the road, as long as you make the conscious effort to get back on track.
  
  I’ll be diving back into my AWS Solutions Architect studies using Stephan Marek’s resources, and I’m excited to make up for lost time. Expect updates on the concepts I explore and how I apply them in practice in my next post.
  
  Stay motivated, and let’s keep pushing forward!

- Day 7 (18/11/2024): **Overcoming Life's Challenges and Diving Into EC2**
  Day 7 marks the completion of my first week on this AWS learning path, and it hasn’t been without its challenges. Balancing professional responsibilities, personal commitments, and self-learning has been more difficult than I anticipated. However, I've realized that the real challenge isn't just external—it's internal. Fighting the urge to use life’s hurdles as   	reasons for slowing down is a battle of willpower. Acknowledging this has been key to pushing myself forward.

  Despite the obstacles, I’m proud to say I managed to make some meaningful progress. This week, I wrapped up learning about Identity and Access Management (IAM)—a critical piece in ensuring secure and managed access to AWS resources. Understanding IAM fundamentals gave me a better grasp of how permissions, roles, and policies are structured within AWS.

  From there, I embarked on my journey into EC2 Fundamentals and made strides with:
  - EC2 Budget Setup: Learning how to set a budget and keep track of costs, ensuring I stay within financial limits while experimenting.
  - EC2 Basics: Gaining foundational knowledge about Amazon EC2 and how it operates.
  - Hands-On: Creating an EC2 Instance with User Data to Launch a Website: This was particularly exciting as I put theory into practice by configuring an instance that automatically deploys a basic website at launch.
  - EC2 Instance Types: Understanding the range of instance types and how to choose the right one based on use cases.
  - Security Groups and Classic Ports Overview: Delving into how security groups work as virtual firewalls to control traffic to instances.
  - Hands-On: Configuring Security Groups: Applying knowledge through practical work, solidifying concepts by managing rules to allow or restrict network access.
    
  Each of these steps has not only deepened my technical knowledge but has also highlighted the importance of securing infrastructure while maintaining efficiency.

  Reflecting on this week, I'm learning that progress is more than just the technical lessons—it’s about developing resilience, managing time, and staying committed despite life's curveballs. For anyone navigating their learning path, remember: it’s normal to face challenges, but it’s how we respond to them that defines our journey.

  Looking forward to sharing more as I dive deeper into the intricacies of EC2 and beyond!

- Day 8 (25/11/2024): *Back on Track with Tutorial Dojo*
Hello, AWS enthusiasts!

It's been a while since my last update, and I must admit I hit a bit of a rough patch. Over the past week, I’ve been battling the flu, juggling work responsibilities, and dealing with extensive travel. Unfortunately, this left little time or energy for consistent study sessions. But as they say, it’s not about how many times you fall—it’s about getting back up. So here I am, ready to dive back into my AWS learning journey with renewed focus!

Switching Gears: Tutorial Dojo + Udemy
While I’ve made good progress with Stephan Maarek’s Udemy tutorial, I recently decided to add Tutorial Dojo into my learning schedule. I found their explanations more engaging and easier to follow, especially for understanding complex topics. The variety in teaching styles is helping me grasp AWS concepts better.

- What did i learn today?
  - AWS Market Place
  - Amazon EC2
  - AWS Lammda
  - AWS Batch
  - AWS Elastic Bean Stalk
  - AWS Outposts

- Day 9 (27/11/2024): A New Beginning Despite the Flu

Today wasn’t the easiest. I’m still battling flu symptoms—fever, body aches, and general fatigue—but I’m determined to keep pushing forward on this AWS journey. Every small step counts, right?

**Shifting Gears:** A Fresh Start with Adrian Cantrill’s Course
After some extensive research, I decided to pivot my learning strategy. I found Tutorial Dojo to be a bit unengaging for my learning style. While it’s great for sample tests and quick references, it didn’t quite resonate with me for in-depth learning.

Enter Adrian Cantrill's AWS Training (found at learn.cantrill.io). I started this course today, and wow—what a difference! Adrian’s explanations are practical, engaging, and incredibly detailed. His approach really clicked for me, and I can already tell it’s going to be a game-changer.

Key Learnings Today: Animals4Life Project and AWS Accounts
One of the highlights from today was diving into the Animals4Life project scenario. This practical use case helped me understand AWS accounts from a real-world perspective. It’s such a refreshing way to learn compared to just theory.

Adjusting My Plan
With this new direction, I’ve decided to:

Stick with Adrian Cantrill’s course as my primary learning resource.
Use Stephan Marek’s course and Tutorial Dojo for sample practice tests closer to the exam.
It feels like starting over, but I’m confident this approach will lead to a stronger foundation.

The New Goal
End of February: Complete the course.
Mid-March: Earn AWS certification.
Even though I’m not fully recovered, I’m giving it my all. Here’s to staying consistent, no matter what challenges come up!

Good night, and see you tomorrow with more updates.
